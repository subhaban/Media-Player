					<h2>Spices and its benefits</h2>
					<p>spices they're good for the soul but they're also good for our bodies
						Hey guys ,Tara here for dnews and if you're a person who enjoys cooking or eating then you'll be
						happy to know that many of the spices we use in our food everyday can also have very real health
						benefits. A new study from the Rush University Medical Center finds that cinnamon can actually
						reverse the anatomical changes that occur in the brains of mice with Parkinson's disease.
						Cinnamon
						has long been known to be great for your health it's loaded with antioxidants and it's
						especially
						helpful for people with type 2 diabetes.A 2010 study found that consuming two grams of cinnamon
						every day for 12 weeks significantly lowered patient's blood pressure and blood sugar levels. In
						another study from that same year found that cinnamon extract can actually increase insulin.
						Turmeric for example which is found in a lot of Indian food may actually help fight cancer it
						contains an antioxidant called curcumin that's been shown to enhance the effectiveness of chemo
						in
						patients with breast cancer so much in fact that it's now being considered as a possible drug
						supplement for chemotherapy it's also been shown to suppress the specific cell pathway that's
						known
						to fuel the growth of head and neck cancer .
						Rosemary has also been shown to minimize the risk of
						cancer the 2010 study found that rosemary is the number one most effective spice when it comes
						to
						reducing the amount of carcinogenic compounds you ingest from cooking groundnbeef it's also
						known to
						have significant antibacterial properties as well as antifungal properties which makes it a good
						home remedy for yeast infections.
						Thyme may actually be the way to go many studies have touted thyme oil as an effective inhibitor
						of
						harmful bacterial growth and raw poultry so if you were to marinate chicken in essential thyme
						oil
						you could greatly extend its shelf life it's even being considered as a possible alternative
						treatment for antibiotic resistant infections like mrsa that plus its anti-inflammatory
						properties
						make thyme one of the best home remedies for acne ginger is also one of the most effective
						natural
						ones out there it contains two key phytochemicals known to fight inflammation which is why you
						typically see it used used in teas for people with congestion or sore throat it's also great for
						arthritis and research published in the journal of pain shows that daily supplements containing
						2
						grams of ginger can actually ease muscle pain from exercising by 25 chili peppers are great
						analgesics the active component in them is called capsaicin and it's been shown over time to
						reduce
						certain pain-causing neurotransmitters it's currently used in topical form for all kinds of
						health
						problems ranging from post-surgical pain to arthritis even things like psoriasis and if that is
						not
						enough it's also known to cause weight loss a 2009 study found that capsaicin can actually alter
						key
						proteins found in fat making it a natural and viable method for reducing abdominal fat of course
						these are just a small handful of spices that are good for your health but there's actually way
						more
						oregano garlic nutmeg and a bunch of others all have their own unique health benefits so eat up
						maybe you can stave off cancer.
