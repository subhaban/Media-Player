have very real health benefits.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
A new study from the Rush
University Medical Center finds that


6
00:00:19.000 -->  00:00:21.000
cinnamon can actually reverse the
anatomical changes that occur in the


7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
brains of mice with Parkinson's disease.

Cinnamon has long been known to be great
for your health it's loaded with 

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 antioxidants and it's especially helpful for people 
 with type 2 diabetes 
 

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.500
A 2010 study found that consuming two grams of
 

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Cinnamon every day for 12 weeks 
pressure  


12
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
significantly lowered patient's blood and 
blood sugar levels. 

  

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In another study from that same year
found that cinnamon extract

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
can actually increase insulin 
sensitivity and improve hyperglycemia in mice



15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
turmeric for example which is found in a
lot of Indian food 
may actually help fight cancer 


16
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it contains an antioxidant
called curcumin 

17
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that's been shown to enhance the effectiveness 
of chemo in patients with breast cancer

18
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
so much in fact that it's now being 
considered as a possible drug supplement

19
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.003
for chemotherapy it's also been shown to
suppress the specific cell pathway

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that's known to fuel the growth of head
and neck cancer 

21
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
rosemary has also been shown to minimize
the risk of cancer 

22
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.500
The 2010 study found that rosemary is 
the number one most effective spice

23
00:01:18.000 -->  00:01:21.000
when it comes to reducing 
the amount of 

24
00:01:21.000 -->  00:01:22.500
carcinogenic compounds compounds you 
ingest from cooking ground beef 

25
00:01:23.000 -->  00:01:24.500

antibacterial properties as well as


26
00:01:25.000 -->  00:01:29.000
antifungal properties which makes it a

27
00:01:30.000 -->  00:01:33.000
Thyme  may actually be the way to go many
studies 

28

have touted thyme oil as an effective 

29
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
inhibitor of harmful bacterial growth
in raw poultry so if you were to

30
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
marinate chicken in essential thyme oil
you could greatly extend its shelf life

31
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
it's even being considered as a possible
alternative treatment for antibiotic

32
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000

acne ginger is also one of the most

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
is called capsaicin and it's been shown
over time to reduce certain pain-causing

known to cause weight loss a 2009 study

44
