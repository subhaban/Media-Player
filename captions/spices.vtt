many of the spices we use in our food


4
00:00:12.050  --> 00:00:14.500
everyday can also 
have very real health benefits.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
A new study from the Rush
University Medical Center finds that


6
00:00:19.000 -->  00:00:21.000
cinnamon can actually reverse the
anatomical changes that occur in the


7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
brains of mice with Parkinson's disease.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.000
Cinnamon has long been known to be great
for your health it's loaded with 

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 antioxidants and it's especially helpful for people 
 with type 2 diabetes 
 

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.500
A 2010 study found that consuming two grams of
 

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Cinnamon every day for 12 weeks 
pressure  


12
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
significantly lowered patient's blood and 
blood sugar levels. 

  

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In another study from that same year
found that cinnamon extract

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
can actually increase insulin 
sensitivity and improve hyperglycemia in mice



15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
turmeric for example which is found in a
lot of Indian food 
may actually help fight cancer 


17
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it contains an antioxidant
called curcumin 

18
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that's been shown to enhance the effectiveness 
of chemo in patients with breast cancer

19
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
so much in fact that it's now being 
considered as a possible drug supplement

20
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.003
for chemotherapy it's also been shown to
suppress the specific cell pathway

21
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that's known to fuel the growth of head
and neck cancer 

22
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
rosemary has also been shown to minimize
the risk of cancer 

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.500
The 2010 study found that rosemary is 
the number one most effective spice

24
00:01:18.000 -->  00:01:21.000
when it comes to reducing 
the amount of 

25
00:01:21.000 -->  00:01:22.500
carcinogenic compounds compounds you 
ingest from cooking ground beef 

26
00:01:23.000 -->  00:01:24.500
it's also known to have significant
antibacterial properties as well as


27
00:01:25.000 -->  00:01:29.000
antifungal properties which makes it a
good home remedy for yeast infections 


28
00:01:30.000 -->  00:01:33.000
Thyme  may actually be the way to go many
studies 

29
00:01:34.000 -->  00:01:35.000
have touted thyme oil as an effective 

30
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
inhibitor of harmful bacterial growth
in raw poultry so if you were to

31
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
marinate chicken in essential thyme oil
you could greatly extend its shelf life

32
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
it's even being considered as a possible
alternative treatment for antibiotic

33
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
resistant infections like mrsa that plus
its anti-inflammatory properties make

34
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
thyme one of the best home remedies for
acne ginger is also one of the most

effective natural ones out there it
contains two key phytochemicals known to

36
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
chili peppers are great
analgesics the active component in them

41

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
is called capsaicin and it's been shown
over time to reduce certain pain-causing

problems ranging from post-surgical pain

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and if that is not enough it's also
known to cause weight loss a 2009 study

45
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
found that capsaicin can actually alter
key proteins found in fat making it a
