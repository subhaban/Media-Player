00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.000
this is kasia if you live in north america you
probably know this spice under the name

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.000
cinnamon but that's not right it's a
pretty common mistake because cassia has

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.000
been sold under the name cinnamon since
the beginning of time you can even find

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.000
it under these different names
and this my friends is cinnamon the real

5
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.000
deal there's a good chance that you've never
seen it before and that's because we

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.000
don't find it easily in north america
latin america is actually the biggest

7
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.000
consumer of cinnamon mexico loves it so
much that it's importing half of the

8
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.000

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.000
because of the long complex harvesting
and drying process the first thing they

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.000
do is harvest three-year-old cinnamon
trees and then the young shoots every

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
year after that the bark is then 
scraped and rubbed vigorously which loosens it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
it's then scored and peeled away with a
special knife


00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the cinnamon will be layered one on top
of the other on a fine metal rod to form


00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a very long stick the last step 
is to let it dry an curl in the open air
